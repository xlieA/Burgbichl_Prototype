# Burgbichl - Beyond the Surface

XR technologies present unique solutions to communicate Cultural Heritage (CH) knowledge to broad audiences. They enhance CH conservation and education by creating engaging learning environments employing storytelling attributes (42.5%), active learning features (37.5%), and Serious Games concepts (35%). This research develops an outdoor AR prototype for the archaeological excavation site on Burgbichl in close cooperation with the team leading the archaeological intervention. The prototype allows users to become archaeologists and interactively explore the site. Playtesting on-site reveals the prototype's quality and usability.

The prototype offers two game versions:
1. **Full Version:** You have to be physically present at Burgbichl for it to work
2. **Test Version:** This version adapts to your current position and works from anywhere
